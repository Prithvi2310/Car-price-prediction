## Overview

This is an educational project aimed at understanding Linear Regression as a concept. The project also focuses on EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and how meaningful insights can be drawn from the dataset. Using this "metadata" we can further optimise the dataset which would only make the model more accurate.
